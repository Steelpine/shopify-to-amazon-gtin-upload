# shopify-to-amazon-gtin-upload
please help build a quick api read for a shopify csv to an amazon csv quick upload. 
amazon has a masterfile csv that it pulls down for a bulk amazon csv load. shopify also lets you pull an inventory file. however the 2 are not easily interlinked. amazon requests you make a master product and variations under nneath with their own 10 digit made up product code. so if your company is abc company, your first gtin number could be abc1234567 etc. master product needs its own. need possibly an api built from shopify to amazon with this gtin built in
